## Assignment
This assignment is a brief overview of the use and purpose of the numpy.random package.
There are four distinct tasks that have been addressed in this Jupyter notebook:

Explain the overall purpose of the package.

Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.

Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.

Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

## Packages Used in the Assignment

## How to run the Jupyter Notebook
For this assignment, I used both Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab at various stages. The asssignment should render on both (and GitHub) without any difficulty. Here are some instructions on how to run the notebook.

If you have not already done so, please download the Anaconda Distribution for Python 3.7.

Once you install Anaconda, the packages listed above should be installed also.

Go to https://github.com/conor-mccaffrey/numpy_random and download the repo

Navigate to the folder you saved the repo in using your CLI or terminal

Change Directory to the folder, for example: -- C:\Users\Teamwork\Desktop > cd C:\Users\Teamwork\Desktop\numpy

You can now run the notebook using jupyter notebook command in the terminal

When opened, run all cells.
