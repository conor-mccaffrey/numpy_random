## An investigation into the numpy.random package

## Assignment
This assignment is a brief overview of the use and purpose of the numpy.random package.
There are four distinct tasks that have been addressed in this Jupyter notebook:

1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.

2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.

3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distributions” functions.

4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

## Packages Used in the Assignment
The following packages have been incorporated for use in the notebook: 

```Python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import scipy.special as sps  

# This  line-orientated magic command, as outlined in lectures, lets us display plots inline
%matplotlib inline
```
Numpy is the primary Python library for scientific computing [1].

Pandas is primarily used for data manipulation and analysis in Python [2].

Matplotlib.pyplot is the foundation of plotting in Python.

Seaborn is also a data visualisation library in Python, which was incorporated for two reasons : to show outside learning/research and also because it displays graphs quite nicely [3]. 

Scipy.special is a Python libray used for scientific computing and technical computing [4]

## How to run the Jupyter Notebook
For this assignment, I used both Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab at various stages. The asssignment should render on both (and GitHub) without any difficulty. Here are some instructions on how to run the notebook.

1.) Download the Anaconda Distribution for Python 3.8.8. Anaconda also contains Jupyter Lab and Jupyter Notebook

2). Go to Github web site and search for 'conor-mccaffrey'
https://github.com/conor-mccaffrey


3). Enter the Repositories section, and select the repository called 'numpy_random'. 

* Another way to acheive the same result is to clone the SSH and enter the following script into cmdr:
git clone https://github.com/conor-mccaffrey/numpy_random.git
This will clone the repository on your local machine.
